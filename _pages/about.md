I am a Master's student at the School of Computer Science, [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), conducting research in the Perception, Interaction, Embodiment Lab (Pie Lab) under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Liang](https://pie-lab.cn/).  
I am interested in the principles and applications of LLMs, VLMs and MM-LLMs. I am currently exploring my research direction.
